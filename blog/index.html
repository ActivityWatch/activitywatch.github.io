<p>In an increasingly digital world, time-tracking software like ActivityWatch plays a pivotal role in enhancing productivity and self-awareness. As we look to the future, three key elements stand out: Artificial Intelligence (AI), privacy, and personalization.</p>
      <h2 id="the-role-of-ai-in-time-tracking"  id="the-role-of-ai-in-time-tracking" id="the-role-of-ai-in-time-tracking">
        
        
          The Role of AI in Time Tracking <a href="#the-role-of-ai-in-time-tracking"></a>
        
        
      </h2>
    
      <h3 id="the-power-of-data"  id="the-power-of-data" id="the-power-of-data">
        
        
          The Power of Data <a href="#the-power-of-data"></a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<p>While ActivityWatch itself doesn’t currently utilize AI, the data it collects serves as a fertile ground for AI-driven applications. The software logs a comprehensive array of your digital activities, from the websites you visit to the applications you use. This data can be transformed into actionable insights through machine learning algorithms. For example, natural language processing (NLP) could analyze your text-based activities to gauge your focus levels, while clustering algorithms could categorize your activities into productivity zones.</p>
      <h3 id="long-term-behavioral-trends"  id="long-term-behavioral-trends" id="long-term-behavioral-trends">
        
        
          Long-Term Behavioral Trends <a href="#long-term-behavioral-trends"></a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<p>AI’s capability to sift through large datasets makes it invaluable for identifying long-term behavioral changes or trends. By applying time-series analysis on your ActivityWatch logs, you can gain insights into how your work habits, focus periods, and even leisure activities evolve over time. This can be particularly useful for self-improvement and for tailoring your work schedule to your natural rhythms.</p>
      <h3 id="day-summaries-and-note-taking"  id="day-summaries-and-note-taking" id="day-summaries-and-note-taking">
        
        
          Day Summaries and Note-Taking <a href="#day-summaries-and-note-taking"></a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<p>Imagine an AI assistant integrated into ActivityWatch that can not only summarize your day but also take context-aware notes for you. Utilizing speech-to-text algorithms during meetings, it could generate summaries and action items automatically. When you’re working on a project, it could log your key milestones based on your activity data, thereby creating a daily journal without any manual input.</p>

<p><strong>How It Could Work:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Speech-to-Text</strong>: During meetings, the AI assistant could transcribe and summarize key points.</li>
  <li><strong>Text Summarization Algorithms</strong>: At the end of the day, a summary of your activities could be generated, highlighting your most productive periods and areas for improvement.</li>
</ul>
      <h3 id="in-context-suggestions"  id="in-context-suggestions" id="in-context-suggestions">
        
        
          In-Context Suggestions <a href="#in-context-suggestions"></a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<p>Think of this feature as a modern, less intrusive version of Clippy. By leveraging real-time analytics and historical data, ActivityWatch could offer spontaneous, in-context suggestions. For instance, if the software detects that you’ve been working on a coding project for an extended period, it could suggest taking a break or even recommend a relevant Stack Overflow thread based on your recent queries.</p>

<p><strong>Technical Details:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Contextual Bandit Algorithms</strong>: These could be used to offer suggestions that are most likely to be useful to you at any given moment.</li>
  <li><strong>Collaborative Filtering</strong>: By analyzing data from multiple users, the system could offer suggestions that have been beneficial to people with similar work patterns.</li>
</ul>

      </h3>
    

<p>The future of time tracking isn’t just about what you’re doing on your computer; it’s about understanding the cognitive processes that accompany those activities. Building on the pioneering research in my <a href="https://github.com/ErikBjare/thesis">MSc thesis</a>, which explored the classification of brain activity using electroencephalography (EEG) and automated time tracking, we see a new frontier emerging.</p>

          🤖 ActivityWatch is now in early beta on Android! <a href="#-activitywatch-is-now-in-early-beta-on-android"></a>
        
        
      </h2>
    

<p>We have been working on getting ActivityWatch to Android for a long time (see <a href="https://github.com/ActivityWatch/activitywatch/issues/6">this issue</a>). There’s a good reason why we think it’s important: in my own analysis, it accounts for almost half of my screen time!</p>

<p>So now we finally have something that you can try out! While not great (yet) there’s a lot to be excited about.</p>

<p>By being backed by our new high-performance implementation of the aw-server written in Rust (see below) it will have the same underlying features and APIs of the desktop version of ActivityWatch, making it a great foundation that will make development easy going forward. The web UI is currently available in the app (but is notably broken in a lot of ways), but we hope to be able to build some native UI elements in the future!</p>

<p>Now we just need to find the time to keep building, but we hope we might be able to find some contributors to help us out with doing so now that we have a solid foundation built on the same APIs already available in ActivityWatch elsewhere!</p>

<p>Get it on the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.activitywatch.android">Play Store</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/ActivityWatch/aw-android">check out the code on GitHub</a>!</p>

          ⚙️ New high-performance implementation of aw-server written in Rust <a href="#️-new-high-performance-implementation-of-aw-server-written-in-rust"></a>
        
        
      </h2>
    

<p>While Python is a great language to quickly build new features in, it’s not great for performance or deploying to multiple platforms (especially Android). So @johan-bjareholt took on the tremendous task of reimplementing aw-server in the highly performant and secure programming language Rust.</p>

<p>This is big news for several reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Since Rust compiles to Android we have built a library for use on Android, letting us avoid reimplement all of ActivityWatch to Android devices specifically (and vastly decreases the time to port future features like sync to Android).</li>
  <li>The high-performance improves battery life on devices like laptops, phones, and tablets.</li>
  <li>The high-performance will make it easier for us to implement weekly summaries</li>
  <li>Having two implementations gives us better testing and encourages work towards common specifications and standards.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Python implementation will still be used for experimenting with new features, but expect the Rust implementation to be shipped with the normal desktop releases sometime in the future!</p>

      </h2>
    

<p>The community has contributed with many new editor watchers the past few months which we appreciate a lot! They have done some awesome work and most of them are even in a better state than the vim watcher we have written ourselves. Thanks everyone for the awesome work!</p>

      </h2>
    
<p>In v0.8 beta 7 we had issues with the windows bundle due to breaking updates of our dependencies PyInstaller and jsonschema. This is now fixed and our windows builds should now work properly again in v0.8 beta 8.</p>

<p>Back in 0.8 beta 6 macOS support was also broken, but that has been working for a while now since beta 7 which has been around for a few months already.</p>

<p>## 📦 Import and export
The import and export APIs now work consistently (<a href="https://github.com/ActivityWatch/aw-server/pull/41">aw-server#41</a>). We have added a UI to export all buckets and to import buckets. Migrating your activitywatch data to another computer is now as easy as using one export button on one computer, moving the file to your new computer and upload it in with the import button! Import and export can also be used if you want to try out the new aw-server-rust and want to move over all your previously logged aw-server data.</p>

<ul>
  <li>🛰️ Raw SQL datastore
    <ul>
      <li>@johan-bjareholt has merged a raw SQLite implementation of the datastore that has performance improvements compared to the current Peewee SQLite datastore. Automatic migration from the old datastore to the new one is supported. The new datastore is however not the default yet, we need more user-testing before doing that. (<a href="https://github.com/ActivityWatch/aw-core/pull/57">aw-core#57</a>)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>🔄 Decentralized sync
    <ul>
      <li>Still being worked on, see last developer update for more info and the <a href="">latest comments in the issue</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>⏱️ Stopwatch beta
    <ul>
      <li>The web-ui now has a stopwatch watcher where you can manually set timers with different tags to track for example how long you have been at work, how long you have been working on a specific project or whatever else you can come up with it being useful for.</li>
      <li>It’s is very limited and lacks some important features, such as manually editing start/stop times. There is also a lack of visualization, it currently only shows a list of the individual entries.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>🖥️ Wayland support
    <ul>
      <li>@johan-bjareholt has had discussions with a few wayland compositor devs and have tried to convince the xdg-desktop-portal API bundle to add a protocol for exposing focused windows appname and title, <a href="https://github.com/flatpak/xdg-desktop-portal/issues/304">but it’s a hard sell unfortunately…</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>🗓️ Weekly summary view
    <ul>
      <li>Weekly/monthly/yearly summaries is a highly requested feature and a high priority for us. We have acceptable performance in aw-server to support weekly summaries, and when we switch over to aw-server-rust we hope to be able to support monthly summaries without issues. Summaries longer than a month will need more work though and won’t be supported in the near future.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>🤖 Better Android version
    <ul>
      <li>The Android app, while technically released, isn’t “production ready” yet. We would ❤️ contributions from people with some Android development experience!</li>
    </ul>

<p>May 7th: We finally released <a href="https://github.com/ActivityWatch/activitywatch/releases/tag/v0.8.0b1">v0.8.0b1</a>. It’s been our first release since November 2017 and is the first beta release of the upcoming (and amazing) new v0.8 release.</p>

<p>May 15th: We hit 4000 downloads 🌟</p>

<ul>
  <li>Implemented our query2 querying language and rewrote much of the visualization code to use it. This is a huge step forward for future visualization work. (<a href="https://github.com/ActivityWatch/aw-core/pull/46">aw-core#46</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ActivityWatch/aw-server/pull/35">aw-server#35</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ActivityWatch/aw-webui/pull/48">aw-webui#48</a>)</li>
  <li>Added a query explorer in the web UI to help with testing queries. (<a href="https://github.com/ActivityWatch/aw-webui/pull/64">aw-webui#64</a>)</li>
  <li>Made watchers more resilient by switching to a new type of request queue. (<a href="https://github.com/ActivityWatch/aw-client/pull/28">aw-client#28</a>)</li>
  <li>Started developing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aw-client-js</code> (<a href="https://github.com/ActivityWatch/aw-client-js/pull/2">aw-client-js#2</a>) and switched to using it in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aw-webui</code> (<a href="https://github.com/ActivityWatch/aw-webui/pull/62">aw-webui#62</a>).</li>
  <li>The web UI now has a view for the most-visited domains. (<a href="https://github.com/ActivityWatch/aw-webui/commit/8f443bc1e258c54f1838994e0f1f79e254d86d6a">this commit</a>)</li>
  <li>The web UI now has a button for removing buckets. (<a href="https://github.com/ActivityWatch/aw-webui/commit/6410170d3192c9e73bb7957ea7e7b9ce606e25ac#diff-32c6cbf8ae7a966f7e41ec78a6d775cb">this commit</a>)</li>
  <li>We now have <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/activitywatch-bin/">a package on the AUR</a> for easy installation on Arch Linux!</li>
  <li>And a bunch of smaller bugfixes and reliability improvements.</li>
</ul>

<p>We’ve been hard at work trying to improve the performance of ActivityWatch (<a href="https://github.com/ActivityWatch/activitywatch/issues/98">activitywatch#98</a>) using several approaches:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Switching to a pure-SQL implementation of the SQLite datastore. (<a href="https://github.com/ActivityWatch/aw-core/pull/57">aw-core#57</a>)</li>
  <li>Pre-merging of heartbeat events. (<a href="https://github.com/ActivityWatch/aw-client/pull/33">aw-client#33</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>We’ll also spend a considerate amount of time developing ActivityWatch this coming summer as we’re a team of five people who will be working on our related project <a href="https://github.com/ActivityWatch/thankful">Thankful</a>. Certainly something to look forward to!</p>
