 - They serve as proof that the project is valuable to our users, which is very useful when we apply to grants.


## What is the money used for?

 - All expenses will be entirely transparent for community review.
 - They will not pay for the work of the current lead developer Erik.
 - Server costs of the forum and other infrastructure.
 - Funding other open source projects that ActivityWatch depends on.
