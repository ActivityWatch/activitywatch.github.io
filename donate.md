## Why do we need donations?

 - They help the sustainability of the project; every dollar improves the probability that the project will be actively developed for a long time.
 - It helps us attract developers to the project.
 - They serve as proof that the project is valuable to our users.


## What is the money used for?

 - All expenses will be entirely transparent for community review.
 - They will not pay for the work of the current lead developer Erik.
 - Server costs of the forum and other infrastructure.
 - Bounties on issues.
 - Funding other open source projects that ActivityWatch depends on.
 - The maintainers reserve the right to spend donations however they think is best.
