      h2 Why use it?
      p ActivityWatch lets you record your digital life, and the new opportunities enabled by such a record.
      p By using ActivityWatch you collect data about how you spend your time, which you can use to:

      ul
        li Record what you do in life.
        li Learn about what you do and how much you do it. See which applications you use, websites you visit, videos you watch, music you listen to and games you play.
        li Estimate productivity by measuring how much time you spend actually getting stuff done.
        li Figure out who actually creates the content you consume and the software you use, so you can reward them accordingly so they are incentivized to continue. (The mission of the #[a(href='#thankful') Thankful] project)
      p ActivityWatch is a collection of programs meant to work together on the same machine (and in the future across machines).

      p
        i You can be in full control of your data if you want to without losing features, there is no requirement that a third party will store your data.
