User Interface
==============

Web Interface
-------------

ActivityWatch comes with a web interface which currently has the following features:

- Activity overview
   - Most used applications by day
   - Timeline
   - Most time spent on a website
     *(requires the ActivityWatch browser extension)*
- Bucket overview
   - When a bucket was last updated
   - Listing of the latest events

More advanced and configurable visualization (such as the ones found in Zenobase and RescueTime) is not a priority and is unlikely to get implemented as a part of the core ActivityWatch project anytime soon.


Tray icon
---------

The tray icon (aw-qt) manages the core ActivityWatch services (server + watchers) and offers:

- Manage which ActivityWatch services to run
- Popup when a service crashes
