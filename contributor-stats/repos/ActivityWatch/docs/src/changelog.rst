v0.8.1
------

Released 2019-11-12

The v0.8 versions are finally leaving beta, and we celebrate this by giving you a truly awesome release!

It's the culmination of a lot of behind-the-scenes work that has been going on for quite a while. Several of our most requested features have made it into this release (categorization, better weekly/monthly visualizations, preparations for syncing), making it our best release yet!

Web UI:

- Categorization is finally here! Including visualizations and settings. The UX still leaves some things to be desired, but it's a great start.
- Daily and Summary views are now merged into one so that you get all the goodies of the Daily view but for arbitrary timeperiods like days/weeks/months!
- Updated the start page, including links to resources like the `user survey <https://forms.gle/q2N9K5RoERBV8kqPA>`_.

Server:

- New unique device ID is now exposed through the info API endpoint, a pre-requisite for building the much requested sync feature.
- Now contains the transforms needed for categorization.

Other:

- There is now a Windows installer available, and it automatically sets up autostart!

v0.7.0b1
--------

Released 2017-06-14

There have been several major changes since v0.6. Much of it wont end up here but hopefully the major things will.

.. note::
    If you are upgrading from a previous version, you might want to stop all loggers for the duration of your UTC offset to prevent issues which we've had difficulty debugging (or you can just start right away and expect your first hours to end up a bit weird).

- Now works on Windows.
- Working standalone packages. (edit: not reliable on all systems, but a lot easier to get running in many cases)
- All timestamps are now in UTC.
- Updated outdated parts of the documentation.
- Makefiles are now used throughout the projects to manage building, testing, and CI.
- A lot of bug fixes (and hopefully not too many new bugs).
- Vastly improved code quality.

----------------
v0.6.0 and older
----------------

We haven't been keeping track of changes very well for older versions. Please refer to the git history.
