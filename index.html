    <i>ActivityWatch</i> is an automatic time-tracking software which helps you keep track of what you do.
  </p>

  <p>
    It's similar to previous services like RescueTime, ManicTime, WakaTime and others but is different in that it's completely open source, extendable and the user alone owns the data.

  <h4>Thankful</h4>
  <p>
    Thankful helps you allocate donations to the creators (of video, writing, music, software) that you appreciate.
    <br>
    <i>No middle men</i> and <i>no privacy issues</i>. A <i>user-controlled</i> alternative to services such as Patreon and Flattr.
  </p>

  <p>
    This will be done by analysing your ActivityWatch data and creating a list of all the creators whos fruits of labor that you have enjoyed.
    Thankful then helps you get an overview of the time spent on each creators content, assisting you in your decision of who's the most deserving.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thankful does not handle your money, instead it gathers information about creators available payment methods such as Patreon and Bitcoin. We are confident that the 10% cut taken by services like Patreon will one day be replaced by cryptocurrencies that have very low transaction fees.
